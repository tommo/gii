The core package contains the core components needed for writing a pyqode based
application. It is the "de facto" requirement for any pyqode extension.

It contains the base classes for both the backend and the frontend and provides
a series of modes and panels that might be useful for any kind of code editor
widget, i.e. pyqode.core is a generic code editor widget.
